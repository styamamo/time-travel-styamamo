# Git Journal
I learned how to manage branches, issues, and merge conflicts. 
I have gained a basic understanding of how a repository works, the concepts of commits, pull requests, and pushes. 
I have also learned how important it is to provide accurate yet brief descriptions and titles when pusing commits.
