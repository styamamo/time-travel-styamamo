# Git Journal
I learned repository basics, the concepts of commits, pull requests. 
I learned how important it is to provide accurate yet brief descriptions with commits.
Two mistakes I have fixed was  not using github desktop and not pulling origin.
the useful feature was copilot auto writing some of my comments.
